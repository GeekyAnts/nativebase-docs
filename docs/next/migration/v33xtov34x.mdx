title: Upgrading to 3.4.0 from 3.3.x
---

<!-- As we continue to improve NativeBase v3 we got a lot of feature requests and we also revamped our theme to make it more consistent, easy to understand, optimized and promote good practices while writing code.

To do that we had to make some changes to our theme in `v3.3.0`. These are breaking changes if you are using some of the tokens in your project. To make it easy for you to upgrade, we are providing changelog: -->

## Changelog

Below is the rough overview of changelog

### Foundation

- Added new color tokens for `text`.
- All colors checked with WCAG 3.0â€™s APCA accessibility.
- Updated derived colors for `danger`, `error`, `success`, and `tertiary`.
- Added letter spacing in headings.

### Components

<!-- #### Color Changes:

- Updated color changes as per new design in the components mentioned below:
- `Alert`, `Progress`, `Spinner`, `Alert Dialog`, `Popover`, `Menu`, `Tooltip`, `Slider`, `Radio`, `Checkbox`, `Link`, `Actionsheet`, `Fab`, `Badge`, `Button`, `Icon Button`,

#### Shadow:

- Added `Shadow` for few components mentioned below:
- `Alert Dialog`, `Popover`, `Menu`, `Tooltip`, `Slider` -->

Added some design changes like color change, shadow, padding and opacity according to new design, in almost all the components.

#### Icon:

- Removed `xxs` from sizes. Use `2xs` size instead.

#### Checkbox & Radio:

- Removed `interactionBox` scaling animation design for hover state.

#### Badge

- Added new warning variant.
- Added a variant with icon.

## Pseudo Props for Color Modes

- Updated theme using `_light` and `_dark` props for light mode and dark mode respectively.
- Internal props will still have higher specifity, as it will override platform props as well as color mode props.

## Theme Decoupling

- In 3.4 we have completely decoupled the theme, all the internal design props are now transfered to theme.
- This will allow you to use multiple theme files in your project, and you can toggle between them very efficiently without breaking a thing.

## Extend previous version's theme for backward compatibility

You need to add `v33xTheme` to your `NativeBaseProvider` which preserves all the old design that was changed or removed in v3.4.0.

```jsx
import { NativeBaseProvider, extendTheme, v33xTheme } from "native-base";

// ...
const yourCustomTheme = {
  // ...
};

<NativeBaseProvider
  theme={extendTheme(v33xTheme, yourCustomTheme)}
></NativeBaseProvider>;
```
