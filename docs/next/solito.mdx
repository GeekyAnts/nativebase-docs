For a long time, the React Native community has been looking for a way to make Universal Apps a reality with Server Side Rendering support. The major roadblock that was stopping us was Navigation. Solito is the most probable answer. NativeBase already works on all three platforms, as we know, making the NativeBase and Solito combination a match made in heaven.
With it, your next application can run with the same codebase on all three platforms. Here is how to proceed.

:::note
If you are looking to make your current codebase into a universal app, It’s really tricky and different for different codebases. Feel free to reach out to us on our Discord Server with such use cases, we will try to help you out as much as we can.

We have already done the hard work for you and created a starter kit for you to start with.

## Getting Started

### Setting up without TypeScript:

- Clone the repo: [https://github.com/GeekyAnts/nativebase-templates/tree/master/solito-universal-app-template-nativebase](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/nativebase-templates/tree/master/solito-universal-app-template-nativebase)
- Run `yarn` or `npm install` on the root directory.
- Then run `yarn` or `npm install` in apps/expo and apps/next.
- Now run `yarn` or `npm install` in packages/app.

That’s it your starter kit is ready to be used.

All your screens and components will be present in packages/app and this can be accessed in the next and expo projects.
