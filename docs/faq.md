#### 1. (Web) Modal not appearing on center or ScrollView not working properly

This can happen if the root element styles are not set as [recommended here](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/setup/#root-element). Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues) in case it doesn't work.
