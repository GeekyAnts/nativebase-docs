title: Migrating to gluestack-ui
---

`gluestack-ui` comes with major changes in philosophy as well as the API. With gluestack, we have re-imagined how we should code for React Native and the web. Therefore, you might encounter a few changes while migrating from `NativeBase` to `gluestack-ui`. Even though it might seem a bit of tedious work, we promise it will be worth it!
Please refer to [this](https://geekyants.notion.site/NB-v3-migration-plan-to-gluestack-86551efc0f894c559136708f0ee821f2?pvs=25) guide while migrating from `NativeBase` to `gluestack-ui`.
