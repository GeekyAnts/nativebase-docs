title: Upgrading to v3
---

`v3` comes with a lot of changes in philosophy as well as the API. We have re-imagined how we should code for React Native as well as web. Keeping this in mind, you might come across a lot of changes while upgrading from v2 to v3. This might seem to be a bit of tedious work but we promise you, it will be worth it!

If you are looking to upgrade NativeBase from `v2` to `v3` in your application, we recommend looking into the following sections first:

- [Introduction](../)
- [Core Concepts](../utility-first)
- [Features](../utility-props)
- [Themes](../default-theme)

This will allow you to leverage `v3` to the fullest. We have further divided the migration guide into different components, so that it's easier to search for a specific one.

We hope that `v3` is able to fulfill all the expectations set by its predecessor and makes the overall UX and DX of your application better.

Happy Coding!
