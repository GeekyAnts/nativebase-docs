title: Blocked/Frozen Components
---

Hey there, we believe in small atomic iterations and maintaining proper flow for continuos support of components and hooks we provide. Therefore after the alpha tests we decided to freeze/block or deprecate few of the components that we felt weren't finished or had a lot of bugs or which didn't make sense to have in our library. Mind you, they might be still exported in few versions. You can find the list of these components down below:

- Accordion
- Breadcrumb
- Cascader `(Coming Soon)`
- CircularProgress
- CloseButton `(Deprecated)`
- Code `(Deprecated)`
- Collapse
- DatePicker `(Coming Soon)`
- KBD
- List
- NumberInput
- Overlay `(Deprecated)`
- Pagination `(Coming Soon)`
- PinInput
- SimpleGrid
- SnackBar `(Deprecated)`
- Stat
- SwipeableList
- Tabs
- Tag `(Deprecated)`
- TypeAhead(AutoComplete)
- Wrap `(Deprecated)`
