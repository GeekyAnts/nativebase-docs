title: Upgrading to 3.2.0
---

As we continue to improve NativeBase v3 we got a lot of feature requests and we also reimagined our theme to make it more consistent, easy to understand, optimized and promote good practices while writing code.

But like everything comes at a price, `version 3.2.0` also comes with a few breaking changes from 3.1.0 . But don't worry we don't want to leave all the hassel on to you therefore we have created a code mod that will run over your project and migrate to v3.2.0 where ever it can and notify you of what is left to be migrated if any.

To upgrade to 3.2.0 just go into your root directory and run the below command.

```bash
npx upgrade native-base-code-mode
```

:::caution

The above **code mod** only works for migrating from **3.0.0 - 3.1.0 to 3.2.0** . I doesn't support migrating from v2 to v3 currently.

- All utility props now takes string values as valid type, number is no longer a valid value type.

  This means that if you pass any value that is a number into a utility prop, then it will be treated as invalid and based on you strictMode config will show you error, warning or just ignore it.

  ```js
  // Incorrect Way to pass utility props
  <Box p={4} mx={8} /> ❌

  ```

  ```js
  // Correct Way to pass utility props
  <Box p="4" mx="8" /> ✅
  ```
